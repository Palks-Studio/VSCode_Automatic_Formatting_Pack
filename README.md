# VS Code – Automatic Formatting Pack (Lite Version)

---

### Version 1.1 – October 2025

**Previous release** Version 1.0 (October 2025) – Initial public demo on GitHub, later replaced by this unified standalone version.
This update consolidates both French and English documentation, removes all Git traces, and ensures a fully standalone structure.
Previous GitHub demo versions have been cleaned and replaced with this unified, verified release.

---

A clean, ready-to-use setup for Visual Studio Code that keeps your files consistent, properly indented and organized — without relying on Prettier, external extensions, or custom scripts per project.

This package contains the public preview version of the pack.
The full version (with ready-to-use scripts: clean.py, convert.py, space.py, automation tasks, installation guide, demos…) is available on Gumroad, Itch or Ko-Fi.

What this pack does:

- Automatically keeps your code clean, aligned, and consistent  
- Works with Python, HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON  
- Normalizes indentation, margins, line endings (CRLF → LF), and UTF-8 encoding  

- Adds useful shortcuts and VS Code tasks:  
  - **Alt + R** → Re-indent the entire file (or a selected block) instantly  
    *(Tip: press **Ctrl + A** first to select all before reindenting)*  
  - **Alt + M** → Toggle minimap visibility  
  - Optional auto-format (Python only: *autopep8* + margin cleanup)

```


The `.mp4` files in this folder (convert_lf.mp4, indent_clean.mp4, etc.) are intentionally included in the Lite version — they are real demonstrations from the full pack, showing its capabilities.

---

## Not included in this version (part of the paid pack)

- `.vscode/extensions.json` — local extension overrides (disable Prettier / RunOnSave)  
- `settings.json` (full version with all editor/formatting policies)  
- `keybindings.json` (full shortcut set)  
- `tasks.json` (tasks wired to the pack scripts)  
- `launch.json` (complete debug presets)  
- `clean.py` — project-wide cleanup  
- `convert.py` — CRLF → LF conversion across the workspace  
- `space.py` — whitespace / extra line detection  
- `INSTALL.md` — installation & usage guide  
- `COMMERCIAL_README.md` — product presentation  
- `docs/TECHNICAL_README.md` — technical notes / maintenance  
- Distribution archives (`*.zip`, `*.tar.*`)

---

## Quick Use (Preview Version)

1. Extract the ZIP archive

2. Copy the .vscode/ folder from public_version/ into your project

3. Open in VS Code — the base formatting setup is ready.

---

## What you get in the full version

- Fully working scripts:

  - `clean.py` → cleans all files (removes extra margins + deletes blank lines only if 3 or more)  
  - `convert.py` → converts CRLF → LF across the workspace  
  - `space.py` → read-only scan (detects extra margins, tabs and blank lines without modifying files)  

- VS Code fully configured:  

  - settings, tasks, launch presets, keybindings  

- Documentation included:  

  - installation guide, technical notes, commercial readme  

- Bonus content:  

  - before/after examples, demo videos, Discord support

### Important — Script Behavior (Full Version Only)

The formatting scripts (`clean.py`, `convert.py`, `space.py`) do not only modify the file currently open in the editor.
They can process all files located at the root of the project, for the following extensions:

| Script       | Main behavior                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `convert.py` | Converts all line endings to **LF (Unix)**                             |
| `space.py`   | Scans files and detects **unnecessary margins or blank areas** |
| `clean.py`   | Automatically removes **extra margins and unnecessary blank lines**     |

Before any modification is applied, a `_backups/` folder is automatically created to store the original files safely.

**About Python formatting**
Automatic Python formatting with autopep8 only works when the corresponding task is manually executed in VS Code (menu “Run Task…”).
This action only applies to the currently active Python file — it never formats the entire project.

**Manual reindentation (Ctrl + A then Ctrl + R)**
This command reindents only the currently active file (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`, `JSON`, etc.).
Exception: Python files are not reindented using this method — they rely on autopep8 instead.
